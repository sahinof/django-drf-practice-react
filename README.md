# React Blog App with Django API

This is a simple blog app built with React using MaterialUI components. It runs on localhost and serves using the Django API. Nothing serious here. This is just a final outcome of a Django + React pratice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
